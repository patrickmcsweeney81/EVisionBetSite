## 1) Target users and jobs-to-be-done

## 2) Bookmaker coverage (AU focus)
Mark those to support in MVP.

- [ ] PointsBet AU  
- [ ] TAB / TABtouch  
- [ ] Ladbrokes AU / Neds  
- [ ] Unibet  
- [ ] PlayUp  
- [ ] BetRight  
- [ ] Dabble  
- [ ] bet365 AU  
- [ ] Betfair (display only)

## 3) Markets & sports
- [ ] Markets: h2h / spreads / totals  
- [ ] Sports: (NBA, AFL, NRL, EPL, etc.)

## 4) EV presentation
- [ ] Table columns (EV%, Prob, Fair, Stake, Book, Price)

## 7) Video walkthrough prompts
Record 5–7 minutes. Suggested flow:
1. What you like about the reference site (speed, clarity, key pages)
2. What you’d change for AU-first bettors
3. Must-have features for the MVP (and why)
4. Nice-to-haves for later
5. Screens you want to copy/avoid
6. Anything that feels slow/confusing

Tips (Windows):
- Win+Alt+R to start/stop Xbox Game Bar recording, or use OBS Studio for more control
- Use a headset mic; close noisy apps; record at 1080p

## 8) Quick decisions
- [ ] MVP bookies list  
- [ ] MVP sports list  
- [ ] EV threshold default (e.g., 3%)  
- [ ] Deploy targets (API: Render/Fly; UI: Vercel)  
- [ ] Auth later (email magic link), demo mode now
